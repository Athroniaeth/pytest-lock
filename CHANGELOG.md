### branch: *"feature/fixture-lock-pickle"*

* **Status:** _Finish_

- [X] If test use `--lock` and `--clean` argument and `--only-skip` argument, then do anything, it's certainly a mistake (why clean only test with existing lock ?)
- [X] If test use `--lock` and `--clean` argument and `--simulate` argument, list all unused cache files who will be removed without remove them.

## Version v0.1.0
* **Date:** _2024-01-xx_
* **Version:** _xxxxxx_

The package upload tests on Pypi were awkwardly carried out with version `v0.1.0` and `v0.1.1`, the package being defective, these were removed but Pypi refuses to change the package contents even after use, even if no download has been made. The first version is therefore `v0.1.2`.
