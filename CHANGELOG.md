## v0.1.0 - v0.1.1
* **Date:** _2024-01-xx_
* **Version:** _xxxxxx_

The package upload tests on Pypi were awkwardly carried out with version `v0.1.0` and `v0.1.1`, the package being defective, these were removed but Pypi refuses to change the package contents even after use, even if no download has been made. The first version is therefore `v0.1.2`.
